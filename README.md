# Blackjack

This text-based game pits you against a programmed Dealer in a virtual casino. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify your starting balance, place a bet for each round, and either hit or stand. Naming yourself after a certain spell-checking quill's mistake may lead to easy profits.

#### Set up:
- clone repository
- open in any Java IDE
- run ui.Main
- know your limit, play within it
