# Blackjack

This text-based game pits you against a programmed Dealer in a virtual casino. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify your starting balance, place a bet for each round, and either hit or stand. Naming yourself after a certain spell-checking quill's mistake may lead to easy profits.

#### Usage: download entire BlackJack package and open in a Java IDE. Know your limit, play within it.
