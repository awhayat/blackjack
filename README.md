This tex-based game pits you against a programmed Dealer in a virtual casino. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify your starting balance, place a bet for each round, and either hit or stand. Naming yourself after a certain Harry Potter nickname may lead to easy profits!

#### Future updates:
